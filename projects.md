# Projects

The projects Iâ€™m currently working on include:
+ a study on causation (jointly with Stephan Kornmesser)
+ a paper on coherence (jointly with Michael Schippers, Mark Siebel, and Stephan Kornmesser)
+ an edited volume on experimental philosophy of distributive justice (to be published with Bloomsbury; jointly with Mark Siebel)
