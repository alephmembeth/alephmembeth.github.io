# Check Me, Replicate Me

We all do mistakes. Sometimes, this happens unnoticed. And sometimes, this doesn’t even matter. But there are some areas where it’s particularly troublesome when we make mistakes. And science, I think, is one such area. Luckily for us, science (and philosophy, I might add) is a collaborative enterprise. And uncovering mistakes is an integral part of it. In this spirit, I invite you to both check and replicate my work.

## Check My Work

Inspired by Gilad Feldman,[^1] I offer to pay you a bounty for every minor or major error you find in my preprinted and published work. Definitions and rules are taken from the websites of Gilad Feldman and Stuart Ritchie.

+ I understand a minor error to be, for example, the incorrect reporting of a numerical result. On the other hand, typos or grammatical errors do not count unless they significantly change the meaning of what is being said. __If you find a minor error in my work, I offer to pay you USD 5.__
+ I understand a major error to be, for example, a flaw in my method, an error in my code that significantly changes the results, or an erroneously drawn conclusion that is not supported by the data. __If you find a major error in my work, I offer to pay you USD 50.__

All errors found in my preprinted and published work will be collected in a separate section of this website. As both Gilad Feldman and Stuart Ritchie note, they “have to be _objective_ errors – not matters of opinion or interpretation.”

## Replicate My Work

Should you be interested in replicating my work, there are a few things I do to make this as easy as possible for you:

+ For projects where I am the first or corresponding author, I try to maintain repositories containing all the essential files (see below).
+ If anything is missing in a repository, please feel free to contact me, and I will try to add the missing files as soon as possible.
+ If you are working on replication of my work, I will be happy to give you feedback and answer any questions you have on the matter.
