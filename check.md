# Check Me, Replicate Me

Everybody makes mistakes. Sometimes, this happens unnoticed. And sometimes, it doesn’t even matter. However, there are some areas where it becomes particularly troublesome when we do so. And science, I think, is one such area. Luckily for us, science (and philosophy, I might add) is a collaborative enterprise. And uncovering mistakes is an integral part of it. In this spirit, I invite you to check and replicate my work. To help you with this, I maintain [repositories](./repositories.md) containing essential files (i.e., primarily data and analysis files) for research projects where I am the first or corresponding author.

## Check My Work

Inspired by Gilad Feldman,[^1] I offer to pay you a bounty for every minor or major error you find in my preprints and published work. Definitions and rules are taken from the websites of Gilad Feldman and Stuart Ritchie.

+ I understand a minor error to be, for example, the incorrect reporting of a numerical result. On the other hand, typos or grammatical errors do not count unless they significantly change the meaning of what is being said. __If you find a minor error in my work, I offer to pay you USD 5.__
+ I understand a major error to be, for example, a flaw in my method, an error in my code that significantly changes the results, or an erroneously drawn conclusion that is not supported by the data. __If you find a major error in my work, I offer to pay you USD 50.__

As both Gilad Feldman and Stuart Ritchie note, they ‘have to be _objective_ errors – not matters of opinion or interpretation.’ All errors found in my preprints and published work will be collected in a separate section of this website.

## Replicate My Work

Should you be interested in replicating my work, there are a few things I offer to make this as easy as possible for you:

+ For projects where I am the first or corresponding author, I maintain repositories containing all the essential files.
+ If anything is missing from a repository, please don't hesitate to contact me, and I’ll try to add the missing files or information if possible.
+ If you are working on replicating my work, I will be happy to give you feedback and answer any questions you have.
