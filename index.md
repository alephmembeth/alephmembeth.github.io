My name’s Kaustubh Dhole! I’m a researcher at Emory University's Department of Computer Science working with [Prof. Eugene Agichtein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3BX3vWcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I'm interested a wide variety of problems which generally fall under Natural Language Processing & Information Retrieval. I graduated from BITS Pilani, India and worked for 6 years in the domain of Conversational AI at <a href="https://amelia.ai/">Amelia (IPsoft)</a> in the wonderful cities of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ICcaaFNX2o">Bangalore</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3fUgOKFMNU">New York</a>.

I am pretty irregular in updating my personal <a href="https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/">blog</a> on Wordpress where you can find some of my random writings on <a href="https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/category/political/">Politics</a>, <a href="https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/category/nlp/">Linguistics</a>, some <a href="https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/2020/02/29/a-few-random-books-that-i-found-interesting-and-a-few-which-i-didnt/"> book reviews</a> and sometimes when I've gone <a href="https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/category/travel/">backpacking</a>!
