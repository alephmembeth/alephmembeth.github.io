Iâ€™m a researcher at Emory University's Department of Computer Science working with [Prof. Eugene Agichtein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3BX3vWcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I'm interested a wide variety of problems which generally fall under Natural Language Processing & Information Retrieval. I graduated from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMVS7AQ6ho">BITS Pilani, India</a> after which I worked for 6 years in the domain of Conversational AI at <a href="https://amelia.ai/">Amelia (IPsoft)</a> in the wonderful cities of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ICcaaFNX2o">Bangalore</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3fUgOKFMNU">New York</a>. I got the opportunity to lead the R&D team of around 10-20 enthusiasts working on diverse NLP topics viz., intent classification, slot tagging, VerbNet & PropBank parsing, KB-based QA, paraphrasing, semantic parsing, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00533.pdf">relation<a/> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03884.pdf">extraction</a> & dialog retrieval, ranking, generation and other conversational AI problems. In the summer of 2022, I worked with the Natural Understanding Team at Amazon, Alexa.

I've a personal <a href="https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/">blog</a> on WordPress where I mostly write non-NLP stuff on rare occasions! You can find some of my random writings on <a href="https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/category/political/">Politics</a>, <a href="https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/category/nlp/">Linguistics</a>, some <a href="https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/2020/02/29/a-few-random-books-that-i-found-interesting-and-a-few-which-i-didnt/"> book reviews</a> and sometimes when I've gone <a href="https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/category/travel/">backpacking</a>!
