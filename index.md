Hi, my name’s Max. I’m a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Oldenburg’s Department of Philosophy, working at the intersection of philosophy and empirical social research in an area known as “experimental philosophy” (or “x-phi” for short). If you want to know more about me, feel free to take a look at my

+ [publications](./publications.md),
+ [presentations](./presentations.md),
+ [taching](./teaching.md),
+ [events](./events.md),
+ [services to the profession](./services.md),
+ [education](./education.md),
+ [employment](./employment.md), or
+ [grants and honours](./financials.md).

Most of this information can also be found bundled in my curriculum vitae, of which you can find the most recent version in English [here](https://github.com/alephmembeth/curriculum-vitae/blob/main/english/cv_english.pdf) and in German [here](https://github.com/alephmembeth/curriculum-vitae/blob/main/german/cv_german.pdf). If that’s not enough, you may also be interested in taking a look at my

+ [latest news](./news.md),
+ [current projects](./projects.md),
+ [brilliant collaborators](./collaborators.md),
+ [academic ancestry](./ancestry.md), or
+ [contact details](./contact.md).

Still not enough? Visit [The Experimental Philosophy Blog](http://xphi.net/) for the latest x-phi related news.

Inspired by [Gilad Feldman](https://mgto.org/check-me-replicate-me/), I invite you to [check and replicate my empirical work](./check.md). Of course, replies to my theoretical work are equally welcome.

By the way, the portrait to the left (or above, if you’re on a mobile device) was painted by the talented [Spiceestew](https://spiceestew.carrd.co/) in the art style of [Disco Elysium](https://discoelysium.com/).
