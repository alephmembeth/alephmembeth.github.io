My name’s Kaustubh Dhole! I’m a researcher at Emory University's Department of Computer Science working with [Prof. Eugene Agichtein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3BX3vWcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I'm interested a wide variety of problems which generally fall under Natural Language Processing & Information Retrieval. I graduated from BITS Pilani, India and worked for 6 years at <a href="https://amelia.ai/">Amelia (IPsoft)</a> in the wonderful cities of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ICcaaFNX2o">Bangalore</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3fUgOKFMNU">New York</a>.
