My name’s Kaustubh Dhole! I’m a researcher at Emory University's Department of Computer Science working with [Prof. Eugene Agichtein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3BX3vWcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) interested in Natural Language Processing & Information Retrieval. I graduated from BITS Pilani, India and worked for 6 years at <a href="https://amelia.ai/">Amelia (IPsoft)</a> in the wonderful cities of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ICcaaFNX2o">Bangalore</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3fUgOKFMNU">New York</a>.

# Publications
   I've become a bit lazy so most upto date stuff may be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=xSGbQ3oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

I am pretty irregular in updating my personal [blog](https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/) on Wordpress where you can find some of my random writings on [Politics](https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/category/political/), [Linguistics](https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/category/nlp/) some [book reviews](https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/2020/02/29/a-few-random-books-that-i-found-interesting-and-a-few-which-i-didnt/) and sometimes when I've gone [backpacking](https://kaustubhdhole.wordpress.com/category/travel/).
